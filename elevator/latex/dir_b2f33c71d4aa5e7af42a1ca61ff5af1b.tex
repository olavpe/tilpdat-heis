\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The driver that communicates with the elevator hardware. This is done through a server that is set up on a port on the machine and communicates with the elevator hardware. The function interactions are identical to the driver provided by the lab instructor in the Embedded Systems course. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{fsm_8h}{fsm.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class that controls the main functions of the elevator. It is responsible for checking input signals in addtion to managing the state of the elevator. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{queue_8h}{queue.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A queue system that helps the finite state machine (fsm) to carry out the orders received from the elevator hardware. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
